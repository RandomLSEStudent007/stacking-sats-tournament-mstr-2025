## 🧩 Phase 1: Data Engineering

### 🎯 Objective

Put on your Data Engineer hat and **Bring Your Own Data** by submitting a pull request (PR) to our data lake. Check out the [pipeline repo](https://github.com/hypertrial/stacking_sats_pipeline) to get started.

Phase 1 isn’t a competition—it's a chance to contribute to an open source repo that will support thousands of tournament participants and capstone teams from top graduate STEM programs. See our [partners page](https://www.hypertrial.ai/partners) for a list of schools we collaborate with.

*Phase 1 is optional, but we highly recommend contributing before jumping into Phase 2.*

## 🧩 Phase 2: Model Development

### 🎯 Objective

Submit the best-performing **Bitcoin stacking model** on [Hypertrial.ai](https://hypertrial.ai)

### 🏆 Confirmed Prize 

- **1 million sats**

### 🎓 Confirmed Participation to Date

- `UBC`, `Georgia Tech`, `UCSD`
