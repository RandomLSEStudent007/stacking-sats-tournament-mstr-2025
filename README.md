## 🧩 Phase 1: Prerequisites

### 🎯 Objective

Learn about Stacking Sats and contribute to our data lake. Check out the [pipeline repo](https://github.com/hypertrial/stacking_sats_pipeline) to get started.

Phase 1 isn’t a competition; it's a chance to learn and contribute to an open source repo that will support thousands of tournament participants and capstone teams from top graduate STEM programs. See our [partners page](https://www.hypertrial.ai/partners) for a list of schools we collaborate with.

_Phase 1 is optional, but we highly recommend contributing before jumping into Phase 2._

## 🧩 Phase 2: Strategy Submission

### 🎯 Objective

Submit the best-performing **Bitcoin stacking model** on [Hypertrial.ai](https://hypertrial.ai)

### 🏆 Confirmed Prize

- **1 million sats**

### 🎓 Confirmed Participation to Date

- `University of British Columbia (UBC)`
- `Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech)`
- `University of California, San Diego (UCSD)`
- `New York University (NYU)`
- `University of California, Davis (UCD)`
- `London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)`

### 🛠️ Environment Setup

Before you begin developing your strategy, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install JupyterLab:

#### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### 2. Activate Virtual Environment & Install JupyterLab

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterlab
```

#### 3. Launch JupyterLab

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
jupyter lab
```

JupyterLab will open in your browser (typically at `http://localhost:8888`). You can now access and work with the tutorial notebooks and develop your Bitcoin stacking strategy.
